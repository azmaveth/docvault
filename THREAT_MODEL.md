## Executive Summary

DocVault is a CLI and MCP-based documentation management system that scrapes, stores, and searches technical documentation. This threat model identifies security risks specific to command-line and local operation contexts, focusing on realistic threats rather than web-application concerns that don't apply to this architecture.

## System Overview

### Core Components
1. **Web Scraper**: Fetches documentation from external URLs
2. **Document Storage**: SQLite database and file system storage
3. **Vector Search Engine**: Uses sqlite-vec for semantic search
4. **MCP Server**: Exposes functionality to AI assistants
5. **CLI Interface**: Command-line access to all features
6. **Embeddings Generation**: Uses Ollama for generating text embeddings

### Data Flow
1. User provides URL → Scraper fetches content → Processes HTML/Markdown → Stores in DB
2. User queries → Generate embeddings → Vector/text search → Return results
3. AI assistants → MCP server → Database operations → Return documentation

## Assets and Their Value

### High-Value Assets
1. **Documentation Database**
   - Contains scraped documentation from various sources
   - May include proprietary or sensitive technical information
   - Search history and usage patterns

2. **API Keys and Credentials**
   - Brave Search API key
   - Ollama connection details
   - Potential GitHub tokens for scraping

3. **Vector Embeddings**
   - Semantic representations of documentation
   - Could reveal information about indexed content

4. **User Configuration**
   - `.env` files with sensitive configuration
   - Database paths and storage locations

## Trust Boundaries

### External Trust Boundaries
1. **Internet → Web Scraper**: Untrusted content from external websites
2. **User Input → CLI**: Commands and parameters from users
3. **AI Assistants → MCP Server**: Requests from AI clients
4. **Ollama API → Embeddings Service**: External embedding generation

### Internal Trust Boundaries
1. **CLI → Database**: SQL queries and file operations
2. **MCP Server → Database**: API-mediated database access
3. **Scraper → Storage**: Content validation and sanitization
