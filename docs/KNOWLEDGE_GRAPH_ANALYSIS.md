# Knowledge Graph Analysis for DocVault

## Would a Knowledge Graph Be Beneficial?

### Current State
DocVault already has implicit graph-like relationships:
- Document → Sections (hierarchical)
- Sections → Cross-references (connections)
- Documents → Tags (categorization)
- Documents → Collections (grouping)
- Sections → Chunks (containment)

### Benefits of Explicit Knowledge Graph

1. **Relationship Discovery**
   - "Find all functions that call `requests.get()`"
   - "Show me error handling patterns across libraries"
   - "What concepts are prerequisites for understanding X?"

2. **Semantic Navigation**
   - Navigate from concept to concept
   - Build automatic learning paths
   - Discover hidden connections

3. **Better Context for RAG**
   - Graph context is richer than hierarchical
   - Traverse relationships for context generation
   - Multi-hop reasoning for complex queries

4. **Cross-Library Intelligence**
   - "How do different libraries implement OAuth?"
   - "Compare timeout handling across frameworks"
   - Pattern recognition across documentation

### Potential Complexity Issues

1. **Maintenance Overhead**
   - Relationships need to be extracted/maintained
   - Graph consistency with document updates
   - Schema evolution complexity

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Graph queries can be expensive
   - Need efficient traversal algorithms
   - Index management becomes complex

3. **Storage Requirements**
   - Duplicate relationship storage
   - Additional indices needed
   - Backup/restore complexity

## Where It Makes Most Sense

### 1. **Entity Extraction Layer**
```
Document → Extract → Entities → Graph
                  ↓
              Functions, Classes, Concepts,
              Parameters, Examples, Errors
```

### 2. **Relationship Types**
- **Structural**: contains, inherits, implements
- **Semantic**: related-to, similar-to, alternative-to
- **Functional**: calls, returns, throws
- **Conceptual**: prerequisite-of, example-of, instance-of
- **Cross-Reference**: see-also, mentioned-in, compared-with

### 3. **Integration Points**
```python
# During document processing
entities = extract_entities(document)
relationships = extract_relationships(entities)
graph.add_nodes(entities)
graph.add_edges(relationships)

# During search
context = graph.get_neighborhood(entity, depth=2)
enhanced_query = add_graph_context(query, context)

# During summarization
related = graph.find_related(section, limit=5)
summary = generate_with_relationships(content, related)
```

## Storage Options

### Option 1: SQLite with Custom Tables (Recommended)
```sql
-- Nodes table
CREATE TABLE knowledge_nodes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    node_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- function, class, concept, etc.
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    document_id INTEGER,
    section_id INTEGER,
    metadata JSON,
    embedding BLOB,  -- for similarity search
    FOREIGN KEY (document_id) REFERENCES documents(id)
);

-- Edges table  
CREATE TABLE knowledge_edges (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    source_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    target_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    edge_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- calls, inherits, related-to, etc.
    weight REAL DEFAULT 1.0,
    metadata JSON,
    FOREIGN KEY (source_id) REFERENCES knowledge_nodes(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (target_id) REFERENCES knowledge_nodes(id)
);

-- Indices for efficient traversal
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_source ON knowledge_edges(source_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_target ON knowledge_edges(target_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_type ON knowledge_edges(edge_type);
```

**Pros:**
- Stays within SQLite ecosystem
- Can leverage existing infrastructure
- Simple backup/restore
- Good enough for most use cases

**Cons:**
- Limited graph algorithms
- Recursive queries can be slow
- No built-in graph operations

### Option 2: SQLite + Graph Extension
Unfortunately, there's no mature graph extension for SQLite like sqlite-vec. The closest options are:
- **SQLite Network Analysis** - Very limited, mainly for network graphs
- **Recursive CTEs** - Built-in but limited and can be slow

### Option 3: Embedded Graph Database
- **DuckDB** with graph capabilities
- **RocksDB** with graph layer
- **Embedded Neo4j** (JVM required)

**Pros:**
- Proper graph algorithms
- Optimized traversal
- Rich query languages

**Cons:**
- Additional dependency
- Sync complexity with SQLite
- Deployment complications

### Option 4: Graph as Auxiliary Index
```python
# Build in-memory graph from SQLite data
graph = NetworkX.DiGraph()

# Persist as:
# 1. Adjacency list in JSON
# 2. GraphML format
# 3. Pickle for Python

# Load on startup for fast queries
```

**Pros:**
- No schema changes
- Use best graph libraries (NetworkX)
- Fast in-memory operations

**Cons:**
- Memory usage
- Startup time
- Sync issues

## Recommended Implementation

### Phase 1: Simple Relationship Tables
1. Add `knowledge_nodes` and `knowledge_edges` tables
2. Extract basic relationships during scraping:
   - Function calls from code examples
   - Class inheritance from documentation
   - Cross-references from "See also" sections
3. Add graph-aware search: `dv search "timeout" --related`

### Phase 2: Entity Recognition
1. Use NLP to extract entities:
   - Function/method names
   - Class names
   - Technical concepts
   - Error types
2. Build relationship extraction:
   - "X is used for Y"
   - "X requires Y"
   - "X is similar to Y"

### Phase 3: Graph-Enhanced Features
1. **Learning Paths**: Auto-generate based on prerequisites
2. **Concept Maps**: Visualize relationships
3. **Pattern Mining**: Find common patterns across docs
4. **Smart Suggestions**: "Users who read X also read Y"

## Example Use Cases

### 1. API Migration Assistant
```bash
# Find equivalent functions across libraries
dv graph find-equivalent "requests.get" --target "aiohttp"

# Result: requests.get() → aiohttp.ClientSession().get()
```

### 2. Learning Path Generation
```bash
# Generate learning path for a concept
dv graph learning-path "async programming python"

# Result:
# 1. Basic Functions → 2. Callbacks → 3. Promises → 
# 4. async/await → 5. AsyncIO → 6. aiohttp
```

### 3. Dependency Understanding
```bash
# What do I need to understand first?
dv graph prerequisites "WebSocket implementation"

# Result:
# Prerequisites: TCP/IP, HTTP, Event-driven programming
# Related: Socket.IO, WebRTC, Server-Sent Events
```

## Performance Considerations

### Graph Size Estimates
- Average documentation: ~1000 entities
- Relationships: ~5000 edges (5x entities)
- 100 documents: ~100K nodes, ~500K edges

### Query Performance
- 1-hop neighbors: <10ms with indices
- 2-hop neighbors: <100ms
- Shortest path: <50ms for most queries
- Full traversal: Avoid, use batching

## Conclusion

A knowledge graph would be beneficial for DocVault, but implement it incrementally:

1. **Start Simple**: Basic relationship tables in SQLite
2. **Prove Value**: Show useful features before complexity
3. **Stay Practical**: Don't over-engineer entity extraction
4. **Keep Optional**: Graph features enhance, not replace

The sweet spot is using SQLite tables for storage with optional in-memory graph (NetworkX) for complex algorithms. This maintains simplicity while enabling powerful features.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Add relationship tables to schema
2. Extract basic relationships during scraping
3. Implement `--related` flag for search
4. Build simple "find similar" feature
5. Measure usage and expand based on feedback
